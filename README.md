## Multi-Agent-XR

This tutorial teaches you how to navigate to the reseources and basic setup of the project.

## Setup local environment

1. **Clone the repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RayChen666/Multi-Agent-XR.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
    ```bash
    cd Multi-Agent-XR
    ```
3. **Install npm**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Open the project:
1. **Open the terminal in the root project folder**:
    if you just want to open and test the backend run
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    if you just want to open and test the frontend run
    ```bash
    npm run start-server
    ```
    if you want to open the frontend and backend at the same time to see the whole workflow run
    ```bash
    npm run dev-full
    ```

2. **Check your local IP address by running**:
    ```bash
    ifconfig
    ```
    For example, 10.21.18.95 is my IP address. 

3. **Navigate to the example**:
    To navigate to the scene, go to your browser (either on laptop or XR headset) and type: https://your-ip-address:8081/.
